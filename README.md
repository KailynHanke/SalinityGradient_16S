# How does salt influence microbial communities?

Question: 

1. How is microbial biodiversity modified across a salinity gradient?
	- Null Hypothesis: Microbial biodiversity (e.g. richness) does not vary along a salinity gradient.
	- Hypothesis: Microbial richness will increase as salt concentration lowers.
		- There is an inverse relationship between richness and salinity


2. How does micorbial composition change across a salinity gradient?
	- Null Hypothesis: Micorbial composition does not change across a salinity gradient.
	- Hypothesis: DOminant members of the microbial community are unique in freshwater compared to salt water.
